## What is MERN Stack?
MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. 
It is used by developers worldwide. The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. 
This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily. 

## MERN Stack Full Form
MERN Stack is a compilation of four different technologies that work together to develop dynamic web apps and websites. 

It is a contraction for four different technologies as mentioned below:

- M - MongoDB
- E - ExpressJS
- R - ReactJS
- N - NodeJS

## MERN Stack Components
There are four components of the MERN stack. Letâ€™s discuss each of them one by one. 

- The first component is MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database management system. 
- The second MERN stack component is ExpressJS. It is a backend web application framework for NodeJS.
- The third component is ReactJS, a JavaScript library for developing UIs based on UI components. 
- The final component of the MERN stack is NodeJS. It is a JS runtime environment, i.e., it enables running JavaScript code outside the browser.
